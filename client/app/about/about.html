          Angel has been a licensed manicurist since 2010 and has personally observed the nail industry constantly reinventing itself to keep up with the latest fashion trends.
          There is nothing more important than assuring a safe and clean environment for the well-being of your clients. Having worked for St. David’s Medical Center for six years, Angel prides herself in practicing immaculate sanitary procedures that she is adamant about.

         Angel aims for perfection when it comes to her specialization in acrylics. Beginning with cuticle work, customized framework, and flush application of acrylic. The durability behind her foundation has often been said to be of no other, allowing her clients to go between three and 6 weeks before needing a fill.

          Nail Art in particular is in high demand internationally and has arrived here in Austin! Angel feels that as a manicurist, it is essential to keep up with what people want. As a booming city, Austin is filled with diversity and fashion trends from all over the world. Austin has gradually jumped on the bandwagon when it comes to trendy nail fashion. There is a plethora of designs and embellishments to choose from. From the more conservative traditional manicure to the designs that will “Keep Austin Weird”, Angel loves the challenge!
