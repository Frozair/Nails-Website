                I prefer not to work over other nail tech’s acrylic work due to
                product and technique differences. It becomes a little more work
                on my end having to reshape/rebalance a set to my style. My number
                one concern is not knowing if you have MMA on your nails. I refuse
                to work over it due to its hazardous properties. Another concern
                is not knowing how long you have actually had the previous set, as
                lifting could have occurred making you prone to fungus and
                bacteria underneath your nail. I usually do an assessment of your
                previous set before making an exception.

            <p class="small-text">
                Methyl Methacrylate is an ingredient that can be found in illegal
                monomer liquids. In the early 1970’s, the Food and Drug
                Administration received numerous complaints of personal injuries
                associated with the use of acrylic monomer formulated with MMA.
                Unfortunately, MMA is still being sold by the gallon illegally in
                the states and is very poisonous to humans. The reports included
                serious nail damage or loss, contact dermatitis, organ damage from
                long term use, soreness and infection due to breaks caused by
                rigidly adhered acrylic.

                No I am proud to say that I use the Tammy Taylor acrylic system,

                welcome to ask to see my product containers and read the
                ingredients.

                disinfected with hospital grade EPA, and sterilized in an
                autoclave after each client.
